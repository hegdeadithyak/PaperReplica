# ADAM: A Method for Stochastic Optimization Replication

## Overview

This repository contains the code to replicate the results presented in the paper "ADAM: A Method for Stochastic Optimization" by D. P. Kingma and J. Ba. The paper introduces a novel optimization algorithm called ADAM, which is well-suited for training deep neural networks.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization, optional)
- TensorFlow/PyTorch (optional, for comparing results with other optimizers)
