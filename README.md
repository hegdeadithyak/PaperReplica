# PaperReplica

## Overview

Welcome to PaperReplica! We specialize in replicating research papers in the field of AI & ML. In this repository, we are currently working on replicating three papers: SSD-RESNET, Vision-Transformer, and ADAM.



## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/PaperReplica.git
   cd PaperReplica
   ```

2. Choose the paper you want to replicate and navigate to its directory:

   ```bash
   cd SSD-RESNET  # or Vision-Transformer, or ADAM
   ```

3. Follow the instructions in the README of the respective paper's directory to replicate the experiments.

## Directory Structure

- [ ] `SSD-RESNET/`: Contains code for replicating the SSD-RESNET paper.
- [x] `Vision-Transformer/`: Contains code for replicating the Vision-Transformer paper.
- [x] `ADAM-OPTIMIZER/`: Contains code for replicating the ADAM paper.
